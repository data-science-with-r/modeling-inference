Hello, and welcome! My name is Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and I will be your instructor for the Modeling and inference course in the Data Science with R Specialization.

>> In the first course of the specialization we introduced the data science cycle with this figure from the book R for Data Science and we learned about data visualization and transformation.

>> In the second course we introduced data tidying, which involved reshaping and joining data, as well as importing data into R.

>> Then we took a break from "how to do a task in R" and asked "should we do this task" in the course focusing on data science ethics. Specifically we discussed misrepresentation of data science results, data privacy, and algorithmic bias.

>> In this course we'll dive into modeling. We'll discuss
> how to fit, interpret, select, and evaluate models,
> how to do prediction and classification and assess the accuracy of our predictions and classificiations,
> and finally how to make inferences from samples for a target population and how to quantify the uncertainty of our estimates from samples

Let's get started!
