## Modelling

- Use models to explain the relationship between variables and to make predictions
- For now we will focus on **linear** models (but remember there are *many* *many* other types of models too!)

## Modeling vocabulary {.smaller}

::: incremental
- **Outcome:** Variable whose behavior or variation you are trying to understand, on the y-axis (aka response variable, dependent variable)

- **Predictor(s):** Other variable(s) that you want to use to explain the variation in the outcome, on the x-axis (aka explanatory variable(s), independent variable(s))

- **Model function:** The regression line for predicting the outcome variable from the predictor variable(s), comprised generally of an **intercept** and a **slope** for each predictor

- **Predicted value:** Output of the model function, which gives the typical (expected) value of the outcome *conditioning* on the predictor

- **Residuals:** A measure of how far each case's observed value is from its predicted value (based on a particular model)
  - Residual = Observed value - Predicted value
  - Tells how far above/below the expected value each case is

## Models - upsides and downsides

- Models can sometimes reveal patterns that are not evident in a graph of the data. This is a great advantage of modeling over simple visual inspection of data. 
- There is a real risk, however, that a model is imposing structure that is not really there on the scatter of data, just as people imagine animal shapes in the stars. A skeptical approach is always warranted.

## Variation around the model...

is just as important as the model, if not more!  

*Statistics is the explanation of variation in the context of what remains unexplained.*

- The scatter suggests that there might be other factors that account for large parts of painting-to-painting variability, or perhaps just that randomness plays a big role.
- Adding more explanatory variables to a model can sometimes usefully reduce the size of the scatter around the model. (We'll talk more about this later.)

## How do we use models?

- **Predict / classify:** Plug in the value(s) of predictor(s) to the model to obtain the predicted value of the outcome

- **Describe:** Quantify the relationship between predictor(s) and outcome with slopes

## Leisure, commute, physical activity and BP {.smaller .scrollable}

**Background:** Whether all domains of daily‐life moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are associated with lower blood pressure (BP) and how this association depends on age and body mass index remains unclear.

**Methods and Results:** In the population‐based Lifelines cohort (N=125,402), MVPA was assessed by the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health‐Enhancing Physical Activity, a validated questionnaire in different domains such as commuting, leisure‐time, and occupational PA.
BP was assessed using the last 3 of 10 measurements after 10 minutes’ rest in the supine position.
Hypertension was defined as systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg and/or use of antihypertensives.
In regression analysis, higher commuting and leisure‐time but not occupational MVPA related to lower BP and lower hypertension risk.
Commuting‐and‐leisure‐time MVPA was associated with BP in a dose‐dependent manner.
β Coefficients (95% CI) from linear regression analyses were −1.64 (−2.03 to −1.24), −2.29 (−2.68 to −1.90), and finally −2.90 (−3.29 to −2.50) mm Hg systolic BP for the low, middle, and highest tertile of MVPA compared with “No MVPA” as the reference group after adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking and alcohol use.
Further adjustment for body mass index attenuated the associations by 30% to 50%, but more MVPA remained significantly associated with lower BP and lower risk of hypertension.
This association was age dependent.
β Coefficients (95% CI) for the highest tertiles of commuting‐and‐leisure‐time MVPA were −1.67 (−2.20 to −1.15), −3.39 (−3.94 to −2.82) and −4.64 (−6.15 to −3.14) mm Hg systolic BP in adults \<40, 40 to 60, and \>60 years, respectively.

**Conclusions:** Higher commuting and leisure‐time but not occupational MVPA were significantly associated with lower BP and lower hypertension risk at all ages, but these associations were stronger in older adults.
