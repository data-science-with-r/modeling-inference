Hint: Use `geom_smooth()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   What types of questions can this plot help answer?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n-   We can use this line to make predictions.

What are values correlation can take?\n\nAdd response here.\n\n-   Are you good at guessing correlation?\n    Give it a try!\n    <https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/guesscorrelation/GuessCorrelation.html>\n\n-   What is the correlation between heights and weights of fish?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Adding a third variable\n\n-   Does the relationship between heights and weights of fish change if we take into consideration species? Plot two separate straight lines for the Bream and Roach species.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Fitting other models\n\n-   We can fit more models than just a straight line. Use `method = \"loess\"`. What is different from the plot created before?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n",
