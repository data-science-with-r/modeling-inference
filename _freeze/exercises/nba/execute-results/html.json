In the early 2000s, NBA teams started to use advanced analytics to gain a competitive edge over their opponents. Teams employ the use of analytics to make data driven decisions on game strategy and business operations. In this programming exercise, we are going to work with NBA data to try and better understand the salary NBA players make.\n\n## Dataset information\n\nThis dataset consists of player per-game statistics for the NBA's 2022-23 season with player salary data. We are going to use just a subset of these variables in this programming exercise. The variables we will use can be seen below. The data key for the entire data set can be revealed below.\n\n| Variable | Description                                                       |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Salary   | Yearly salary a NBA players make in USD                           |\n| Position | Position on the court the NBA player plays: PG, SG, SF, PF, and C |\n| Age      | Age of the player, rounded to the nearest year                    |\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n#| label: load-nba-data\nnba <- read_csv(\"nba20222023.csv\") \n\nglimpse(nba)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Data key\n\nNeed to expand\n\n| Variable | Description                                                       |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Salary   | Yearly salary a NBA players make in USD                           |\n| Position | Position on the court the NBA player plays: PG, SG, SF, PF, and C |\n| Age      | Age of the player, rounded to the nearest year                    |\n| Team     | Team of the NBA player                                            |\n| GP       | Total number of games played                                      |\n| GS       | Total number of games the player started                          |\n| MP       | Average number of minutes played                                  |\n| FG       | The total number of shots made (2P + 3P)                          |\n| FGA      | The total number of shots taken (2PA + 3PA)                       |\n| FG%      | The percentage of all shots made (FG / FGA)                       |\n| 3P       | The total number of 3-point shots made                            |\n| 3PA      | The total number of 3-point shots taken                           |\n| 3P%      | The percentage of 3-point shots made (3P / 3PA)                   |\n| 2P       | Total number of 2-point shots made                                |\n| 2PA      | Total number of 2-point shots attempted                           |\n| eFG%     | Effective Field Goal Percentage ( (FG + 0.5\\*3P) / FGA) )         |\n| FT       | Total number of free throws made                                  |\n| FTA      | The total free throws attempted                                   |\n| FT%      | The percent of FTs made (FT / FTA)                                |\n| ORB      | Average offensive rebounds per game                               |\n| DRB      | Average defensive rebounds per game                               |\n| TRB      | Total rebounds (ORB + DRB) per game                               |\n| AST      | Average assists per game                                          |\n| STL      | Average steals per game played                                    |\n| BLK      | Average blocks per game played                                    |\n| TOV      | Average turnovers per game                                        |\n| PF       | Average fouls accrued per game played                             |\n| PTS      | Average points scored per game played                             |\n:::\n\nNow, let's explore these data!\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n::: exercise\nBefore we fit a linear regression model, we are going to explore the data. Let' start with exploring our response variable of interest, cholesterol (`Salary`). Specifically, we are interested in the relationship between `Salary`, `Age`, and `Position`. Below, calculate the mean and standard deviation for your quantitative variables. In the same code, produce the count of each position.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnba |>\n  group_by(Position) |>\n  summarize(mean_salary = mean(Salary, na.rm = TRUE), \n            sd_salary = sd(Salary , na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_age = sd(Age, na.rm = TRUE),\n            position_n = n())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  Position mean_salary sd_salary mean_age sd_age position_n\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>  <dbl>      <int>\n1 C           7282722.  8983558.     26.3   4.48         91\n2 PF          8885045. 10897789.     26.6   4.78         86\n3 PG         11579573. 13889342.     26.2   4.35         77\n4 SF          8132253. 11055604.     25.6   3.64         91\n5 SG          6681301.  8308597.     24.7   3.85        115\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Visualizing the data\n\nWe are now going to plot our response variable `Salary` vs `Age` using a scatterplot. We are also going to color the points based on `Position`. The plot can be seen below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](nba_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the videos, we learned about two different times of multiple linear regression models that we could fit:\n\n**Additive models**: The relationship between x and y does not change based on z\n\n**Interaction models**: The relationship between x and y does change by z\n\n::: exercise\n(Thought exercise) Based on these definitions, do you think it would be appropriate to fit an additive or interaction model?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\nIt is justifiable to fit an interaction model instead of an additive model. Based on the scatterplot, we can see that the relationship between Salary and Age changes depending on the position the player plays.\n:::\n\n## Modeling\n\nSo we can explore both concepts, regardless of your conclusion in the though exercise, we are first going to fit an additive model. We are going to this to:\n\n-- Show that R will still fit the model, despite it not being the most appropriate\n\n-- Practice fitting additive models\n\n-- Practice interpreting additive model output\n\n#### Additive model\n\n::: exercise\nFit the additive model below. Name this model `m1`, and wrap this object in the `tidy()` function. Next, interpret the estimate for `PositionPF` in the context of the problem.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\n\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- linear_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |>\n  fit(Salary ~ Age + Position, data = nba)\n\ntidy(m1) |>\n  select(term, estimate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  term          estimate\n  <chr>            <dbl>\n1 (Intercept) -20019456.\n2 Age           1038670.\n3 PositionPF    1307286.\n4 PositionPG    4391276.\n5 PositionSF    1602852.\n6 PositionSG    1095288.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs an NBA player ages one year, we estimate a mean salary increase of 1,307,286 usd if they play PF.\n:::\n\n::: exercise\n(Thought exercise) What position do you not see a term for? Where is it?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\nWe don't see a specific term for `C`. That is because it's our `(Intercept)` term! We can interpret the intercept as: For an age of, we estimate the mean salary of an NBA C to be -2,0019,456 usd. Each other position estimate is the estimated difference in `Salary` relative to the C, after controlling for Age!\n:::\n\nWe can change the intercept. See the following code that changes the intercept to `PG`, and notice how the estimates change based on what our intercept term is! Note: `Age` does not change, because the relationship between Salary and Age does not depend on Position.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnba_diff <- nba |>\n  mutate(Position = fct_relevel(Position, \"PG\"))\n\nm2 <- linear_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |>\n  fit(Salary ~ Age + Position, data = nba_diff)\n\ntidy(m2) |>\n  select(term, estimate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  term          estimate\n  <chr>            <dbl>\n1 (Intercept) -15628180.\n2 Age           1038670.\n3 PositionC    -4391276.\n4 PositionPF   -3083990.\n5 PositionSF   -2788424.\n6 PositionSG   -3295988.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Interaction model\n\n::: exercise\nNow, it's time to fit the interaction model between `Salary`, `Age`, and `Position`.

The term Age:PositionPF has a coefficient of 556,044. This is the estimated difference in the slope coefficient vs the Center position. Thus, the slope coefficient specifically for the PF position is estimated to be 414,290 larger than the baseline.\n:::\n\nNote: This is the mathematical representation to the plot created above!\n\nIf we do change the baseline term, the `Age` coefficient will also change, because the interaction term allows for the relationship between `Age` and `Salary` to change based on `Position`. Let's see this below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm3 <- linear_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |>\n  fit(Salary ~ Age * Position, data = nba_diff)\n\ntidy(m3) |>\n  select(term, estimate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   term             estimate\n   <chr>               <dbl>\n 1 (Intercept)    -33327869.\n 2 Age              1714364.\n 3 PositionC       29720679.\n 4 PositionPF      16431366.\n 5 PositionSF       2832880.\n 6 PositionSG      18408190.\n 7 Age:PositionC   -1300074.\n 8 Age:PositionPF   -744030.\n 9 Age:PositionSF   -203152.\n10 Age:PositionSG   -838134.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## In Summary\n\n-- Multiple linear regression allows for a single quantitative variable to be modeled by \\> 1 explanatory variable.\n\n-- An additive model has the restriction of keeping the relationship between x and y consistent , regardless of the values of the other variables in the model.\n\n-- An interaction model relaxes this restriction, and allows the relationship between x and y to change based on values of z.\n\n-- Regression output has a baseline group when one explanatory variable is categorical. This can be found in the `Intercept` term, with the other categorical level coefficients representing the deviation from the baseline.\n\n## Your Turn: Challenge\n\nUse this space to fit more complicated models, and explore different relationships that model our response variable `Salary`!
